The first two are `Synth.wav` (audio $\\mathbf{A}$) and `Piano.wav` (audio $\\mathbf{B}$), which are recordings of a chromatic scale in a single octave played by a synthesizer and a piano respectively. The third piece of audio is the intro melody of “Blinding Lights” (audio $\\mathbf{C}$) by The Weeknd, played with the same synth tone used to generate `Synth.wav`.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to compute the spectrogram of the music file. First, read and load the audio file at its correct sample rate (44100 in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python, you can use [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) to load the wav file as follows (we also recommend using the numpy package for matrix operations below if you use python):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import librosa\n",
    "audio, sr = librosa.load(filename, sr = None) # sr = None means the audio will be loaded with its original sr - sample rate\n",
    "assert sr = 44100 # we want to make sure the computed sr from the music file is what we expect - 44100 Hz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can compute the complex Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the signal and its magnitude spectrogram. Use `2048` sample windows, which correspond to 64 ms analysis windows; overlap/hop length of `256` samples to 64 frames by second of signal. Different toolboxes should provide similar spectrograms. If\n",
    "you are using the Python Librosa library, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spectrogram = librosa.stft(audio, n fft=2048, hop length=256, center=False, win length=2048)\n",
    "M = abs(spectrogram)\n",
    "phase = spectrogram/(M + 2.2204e-16)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $\\mathbf{M}$ represents the music file and should be a matrix, where the rows correspond to the frequencies and the columns to time. For visualizing the spectrogram, see the documentation online for `librosa.display.specshow`."
